          1. How-to Post Let’s start the list by discussing the most common type
          of blog post – a “how to.” Write a series of blog posts outlining a
          step-by-step process for how to solve common challenges you see
          customers facing each day. There is likely a whole new audience of
          people who have similar questions but are turning to Google for their
          answer. By finding your blog post through their search queries your IT
          company grows brand awareness and thought leadership. 2. Case Studies
          Case studies are a great way to showcase how your brand, products, or
          services solved a customer’s challenge. It serves as a real-world
          example of how organizations can serve to benefit from working with
          your IT company by walking through your process from start to finish.

          is to educate customers on new services, solutions, and ways to use
          technology (IE: product updates or features). The article can simply
          summarize: The name of the product update. What problems the update
          will solve. The benefit of the update for the end-user. Any necessary
          steps the end-user must take.
